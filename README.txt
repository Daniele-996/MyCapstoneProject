💼 CAPSTONE PROJECT by Daniele Sanzari

💡 I would like to develop an application useful for managing offices and renting rooms to professionals.
This should be managed both by the administrator, who manages the professionals and rooms, and by the professional, who can view available and/or occupied rooms.

🛠️ For the capstone, I will use:

Frontend:
⚛️ React-Bootstrap
⚡ ViteJS
💻 IDE: Visual Studio Code

Backend:
☕ Java Spring
🧩 Maven
🐘 PostgreSQL
🧠 IDE: IntelliJ

✨ I've been thinking about developing an app like this because it could be useful to a relative of mine in his work, and I'd be happy to accomplish my goals.
